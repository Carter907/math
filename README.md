# Math
rust utility binary for basic math operations that I use for productivity purposes. I made this as a simple way to check my work from the command line while in class.

# Installation
clone the repo and enter the following in the command line.
```shell
cargo install -f --path .
```
>this will install the binary in your .cargo/bin directory

this requires cargo to be installed. make sure your cli has access to the cargo 
executable via your environment variables.
